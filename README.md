# Aarogya Saathi in Progress Still
*Aarogya Saathi* is an AI-powered voice-first healthcare assistant designed for rural India. It bridges the healthcare gap by providing vital medical guidance via basic feature phones (through IVR) and a lightweight Android app that functions offline and supports multiple Indian languages.

## üí° Problem Statement
Millions in rural India lack access to timely healthcare due to poor infrastructure, limited internet, and digital illiteracy. Aarogya Saathi aims to empower ASHA workers and rural individuals with an accessible AI tool for pregnancy risk assessment, disease guidance, and awareness about government health schemes.

## üöÄ Features
- Voice-based interaction in Hindi and regional languages.
- Pregnancy risk assessment through guided Q&A.
- Health scheme information in a simple tile layout.
- Offline-first app with auto-sync for ASHA dashboards.
- Works on both feature phones (via IVR) and smartphones.

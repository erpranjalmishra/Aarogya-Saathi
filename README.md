# Aarogya-Saathi 💊  
**Empowering Rural Healthcare with AI – Boosted by Intel® oneAPI**

Aarogya-Saathi is a smart, AI-powered rural health support system that provides intelligent diagnostics and health risk analysis using user-friendly local interfaces. It aims to assist healthcare workers and individuals in rural areas by providing reliable, low-resource, real-time health evaluations even in the absence of doctors.

> 🚀 Built by me, Pranjal Mishra, with some help from Intel® oneAPI tools and accelerators for optimized performance across diverse hardware.

## 🚀 Intel® oneAPI Integration

Using Intel® oneAPI, I was able to:

- Train models faster using **Intel® Distribution for Python** and **oneDAL**.
- Improve parallel performance on Intel hardware.
- Optimize inference latency for use on low-power devices.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **User Inputs Symptoms** (Hindi/English).
2. **ML Model** matches symptoms to probable diseases.
3. **Output**: Probable diagnosis + Suggestions.
4. **(Optional)** Send report to local health center.
